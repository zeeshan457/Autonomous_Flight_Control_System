## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Autonomous Flight Control Drone project is an innovative and challenging endeavor that aims to develop an intelligent drone capable of flying autonomously, navigating through predefined waypoints, and avoiding obstacles in real-time. The drone will utilize cutting-edge Java programming techniques to create an efficient and reliable autonomous flight system.
Key Features:


    1.	Waypoint Navigation: The drone will be equipped with GPS technology, enabling it to follow a predefined flight path composed of waypoints. Java algorithms will be implemented to calculate the optimal path between waypoints, considering factors such as distance, altitude, and speed.
    2.	Obstacle Avoidance: To ensure safe flight, the drone will employ various sensors, such as Lidar and cameras, to detect and avoid obstacles in its path. Java-based computer vision algorithms will process sensor data, allowing the drone to adjust its flight trajectory in real-time to avoid collisions.
    3.	Flight Control System: The project will focus on creating a robust flight control system using Java that stabilizes the drone, maintains altitude, and controls its orientation. PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control algorithms will be employed to achieve smooth and stable flight.
    4.	User Interface: A user-friendly Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) will be developed to interact with the drone. The GUI will allow users to define flight plans, monitor the drone's status, and modify parameters like speed and altitude.
    5.	Safety Measures: The project will prioritize safety by implementing emergency stop procedures and fail-safe mechanisms to ensure the drone can be controlled manually or return to a safe location if any critical issues arise during autonomous flight.
    6.	Data Logging and Analysis: The drone will be equipped with onboard data logging capabilities to record flight data such as sensor readings, waypoints reached, and flight duration. Java-based data analysis tools will be developed to extract insights from the collected data.
